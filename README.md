A food blog for modest and clean fitness recipes.

## Major modifications of the standard jekyll template:

* Modern and minimal custom design
* 'Responsive' by using the [ZURB foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) front-end framework and therefore compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  

* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) integrated for social sharing.
* [Owl Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) for the recommendation wrapper.
* [Salvattore](http://salvattore.com/) as a jQuery Masonry alternative with CSS-driven configuration.
* [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) as a SEO-friendly and fast lazyloader for responsive image loading.
* recipe template matching the schema.org specification.
